# PyFactorGraph

The primary purpose of this is so that people working in Python can avoid having
to re-write different data providers for each project and data set they work on.
The factor graph object and functions provided here allow for {reading, writing,
accessing} of measurements and variables.

We provide examples for working with the Extended Factor Graph format (`.fg`)
and pickled `FactorGraphData` objects (`.pickle`) in the `/examples` directory.

Also potentially useful, auto-documentation of this code can be found in the
`/docs` directory.

## Getting Started

Installing this package is quick and easy!

```bash
cd ~/PyFactorGraph
pip install .
```

Ta-da you should be ready to go!
